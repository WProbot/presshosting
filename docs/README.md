## They aren't all alike!

![](/different-640.jpg)

When you research web hosting you'll see masses of features that all look pretty much alike. Is there truly any difference among the many web host providers?

In the case of WordPress web hosting, the answer is absolutely yes: there are half a dozen or so features to look for, and once you know that list you will discover that the universe of choices shrinks dramatically. If you don't make sure those features are part of the deal, you will be very unhappy at some point, most likely the night before a deadline. I've made every mistake that can be made regarding web hosting, so please, learn from them.

## "Unlimited MySQL Databases"? Huh?
![Yes, you'll probably need "unlimited servers"](/server-311338.svg)
Let's get the most obscure and perhaps most important feature out of the way first. The web host should allow unlimited MySQL databases. The next obvious question is WTF? We're talking about websites and WordPress, not databases.

Each copy of WordPress requires one MySQL database to run. That's one of the cool things about a program like WordPress. By storing everything from article text to videos to images in a database, WordPress can do things with incredible ease that a handcoded, non database-driven would have extreme difficulty doing: change its appearance by changing themes, show articles in completely different ways with the click of a button (show dates? Don't show dates? Organize news items into monthly archives automatically? Free built-in search engine? Check, check, check. And check.)

And although you probably can't imagine this will ever happen, you want *unlimited databases* (some web hosts limit the number of MySQL databases for performance or revenue generation purposes), you will, I promise, build another website. Which brings us to domain names.

## Who Needs Unlimited Domain Names?

It takes an hour or so to learn WordPress. In another couple hours you'll be so good that you'll have another idea for a website. No problemo. WordPress lets you knock together 100% professional sites that are as easy to use as a word processor--all in seconds. As part of your hosting deal, you want no limit to the number of domain names you can host all for the same low--yes, it will be low, if you choose right--monthly price.

## CPanel: What Is It and Why Do I Care?
![Control panel pictures](/building-1853330_1280.jpg)

When evaluating Word Press web hosts, you must choose one with CPanel. Your Wordpress web host runs an operating system that won't look like the Windows, Mac, or iPad you're accustomed to at work and home. It will be a "shared hosting" account that runs under the free but somewhat abstruse Linux operating system, or one of its variants.

CPanel purports to be an "easy to use" layer over Linux. It's not. Using web hosting software is a bitch, and that's on a good day. CPanel has been for years now the best combination of reliable, somewhat documented, inexpensive, and an industry standard. Better yet, it has Fantastico Deluxe, which installs a perfect, working web site using Word Press in a few seconds.

If you can imagine the way Windows was in 1993, or the obscure predecessor to the Macintosh operating system devised by engineers for Xerox in 1972 before Apple licensed its ideas and made them better? CPanel is like that. But way worse.  However, it's better than the alternatives.

CPanel is therefore good because other people use it-CPanel experts are easy to find. This rules out GoDaddy, which has some kind of half-assed homebrow hosting environment. That's fine. They are a top-notch choice for registering domain names. Just not web hosting. 

## Fight The Power: Do Not Use Your Web Host For Domain Names
 
Speaking of domain names, DO NOT get web hosting at the same provider that hosts your site. The reason is disaster preparation. If the same company hosts your web site as points the domain name to the site, then when the power goes out, you lose your website completely.

If you host your website at a provider separate from your domain name registrar and the power goes out at the web host, all you have to do is repoint your domain name to the new server. Takes only a few moments and can mean the difference between life and death for your online business. If the same company manages both and there's an earthquake or tornado or brownout or rolling blackout or generator failure or someone pays the bills: you're hosed. That's a technical term meaning "your competition is laughing its brains out at you".

## Novice-Friendly 24-Hour Support
![Support options](/man-1079245_1920.jpg)

Chances are pretty good that your first website will be at least partly an after-dinner, maybe even middle-of-the-night passion project. Not to snow you with obscure statistics or anything, but I can promise with 162% certainty that your site will appear to vanish or behave inconsistently only during night hours. 

Sure, night hours, you say, but which timezone? You're hilarious. Really, I mean it. Or maybe you feel you are somehow immune to the inevitability I have herein described. Fine. I'll go along with you. I define "night hours" as "when you least expect or want to be diddling with poorly a documented server configuration, your teenager hasn't got around to doing the dishes, and your spouse would like to see you one time this week without talking about work and oh by the way are you going to call your credit card service line about that weird $74.65 charge?"

Most sites don't have 24 hour support, so treasure the ones you find that go that extra mile.

Bonus tip: Test customer support out before you buy. Ask them any relevant technical question (for example, "Do you offer unlimited MySQL databases and unlimited domain names?") then see how long they take to respond.
Look For Phone Support

It's not a deal killer, but phone support is a rare perk you may be interested in. I know of only one web hosting provider that offers real 24 hour phone support, but a few at least have it during business days.

I have learned that phone support can be a crutch. When you are forced to use online ticketing systems, you must describe the problem clearly enough that someone not familiar with your site can reproduce it. If all you have to do is call and babble you are not as likely to follow the minimum steps you should have performed anyway. I copy help tickets before submitting them, then include both question and answer in my personal notes so I can save time when the incident happens again. And it will happen again.

## Sure Your Idea is Awesome And Everyone Will Love It. Stick To Shared Hosting Anyway, With One Exception

Hosting options usually include, from cheapest to most expensive
* Shared
* VPS (Virtual Private Server)
* Dedicated Server

Choose **shared**. It's the cheapest and maybe, but not always, the slowest. Shared means that you and dozens or hundreds of others are running on a single computer, competing for the same resources. Sounds like performance would be terrible, but choose a reliable web host and that will seldom happen. The good news is that the web host provider is responsible for hardware problems. If a router, motherboard, or hard disk goes bad, you don't want to be responsible for diagnosing the problem, then ordering the new part and replacing it.

A **dedicated server** is an actual machine set aside at the hosting facility with your name on it. OK, maybe not labeled with a Sharpie, but if you want you can go visit it and see it in the, ah, flesh. The bad news is, that may be necessary. Remember that whole broken hard disk thing? If it happens to your dedicated server, you will indeed have to visit the data center and fix the damn thing. Then you'll have to reinstall the operating system, restore your backups (you kept backups, right?) Dedicated servers are the fastest option.

If that doesn't sound so bad, remember that you also have other requirements mentioned in this article: unlimited domain names, unlimited SQL databases, 24 hour support, etc. All that and close enough for you to visit when the site goes down at 2am. Not bloody likely.

A **VPS** is a software illusion. From your end it looks very much like a dedicated server but is in fact a program that simulates a dedicated server. Performance is quicker than a shared server but probably slower than a dedicated server. The web host maintains the machine it runs on, so if something goes wrong you don't have to drive in but you will have to reboot the virtual server and diagnose its problems remotely. Still way too much work for a WordPress site.


## This secret will save you heartache

My secret backup reason for using shared hosting as the default is that the web host provider is responsible for support. Normally a VPS or dedicated server is even more fiendisly complex than CPanel, but because you have far more control over the server, you are expected to provide your own support for the most part. 

Your goal is to get a site so compelling and popular that you're making massive amounts of money and have no choice but to hire a team of brilliant ex-Facebookers to wear lab coats and mill through gleaming towers of state-of-the-art hardware. Barring that the performance/price/ease of use considerations point firmly in the direction of a shared server.

There's one exception: adult sites. They tend to be bandwidth hogs and can get you kicked off a shared server in no time.

## No Annual Contract Or: How Much Is Overpaying?

Web hosting is, gloriously for you, a buyer's market. Do not pay for an annual contract until the company has demonstrated its consistency for a period of months. Even then there's no reason to because the market is so overserved.

A *shared hosting account* with all the features discussed here should cost no more than $15-$20 per month. If you were foolish enough to hire a webmaster whose preferred web host provider charges any more than that, you are overpaying so that your webmaster can wallow around in a recurring revenue stream like a hippo at a deep mud hole. Unless this comes with something very special, like weekly massages or 24 hour on-call access to your webmaster, stay in the $10-$20 range.
